		"changelog": "# Release 2.5\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis release is not state-compatible with previous software versions; configuration scripts need to be adapted and will need to be reapplied.\n\n## New Features\n\n**IPA/AT300** There is a new IP Audio Engine application with extensive audio mixing & signal processing features\n\n**AVP/AT300* The AVP_100GbE application now supports audio mixing\n\n**AVP/AT300* The AVP_100GbE application now supports loudness metering\n\n**AVP/AT300** Fix 'one-shot' bug where a non-looping audio player could lock up the entire machine\n\n**AVP/AT300** Fix compatibility with PTP v2.1 devices\n\n**ALL** Network settings can now be changed atomically by uploading properly formatted JSON documents to `http[s]://<ip>/network_config`. A textual API description will be provided later, but can already be obtained from the TypeScript signature of VAPI's `<vm>.network_interfaces.upload_config` method\n\n**GUI** Audio players can now be configured, and loaded with audio files (.wav or our proprietary .biw format) from the landing page\n\n**AVP** Video players can now be configured to automatically restore their contents from external USB storage devices on startup\n\n**GUI** If an external USB storage medium is connected, and contains appropriately formatted clips or stills, these files can now be uploaded to video players from the landing page\n\n**GUI** There is preliminary UI support for stereo (audio) mixers\n\n**PCAP** The PCap_100GbE application now supports timed replay of user-provided pcap files (to be uploaded via http to `http[s]://<ip>/pcap?instance=<0|1>`; on-the-fly zstd decompression is supported)\n\n**GUI** Table rows can now be renamed from the advanced UI\n\n## Changes/Enhancements/Bug fixes\n\n**RTPTransmitter** Advertise estimated video stream bandwidths using b=AS:([0-9+]) lines\n\n**IPA** Fix signal corruption issue in compressor\n\n**IPA** Fix bug in loudness computation\n\n**PTP** Make DSCP user-configurable\n\n**RTPReceiver** Fixed sdp parser crash on missing 2110-20 packing format\n\n**Matrix** Added custom validator for `t_src` / `audio_timing` keywords (s.t. VAPI `write` calls will now succeed without having to explicitly specify a custom validator at the call site)\n\n**RTPReceiver** Fixed spurious RX errors that might be reported by audio receivers on stream startup (this could happen in previous software versions due to an incorrect deactivation/activation sequence)\n\n**Matrix** Fixed \"long\" audio delay times (previously, delays above 5s would silently truncate to some value less than 5s)\n\n**Matrix** Fixed several crashes that might happen during video player allocation and deembedder assignment\n\n**AVP** Fixed FPGA bug in the audio delay component's timing engine\n\n**Matrix** Added custom validator for the audio replay component's `num_channels` keyword\n\n**Matrix** Fixed typo in BIW header parsing (backwards-compatibly, so mistyped legacy files will still be accepted)\n\n## Overview\n\n**AT300/AVP_100GbE** 36x RTPVidTx, 32x RTPVidRx, 511x RTPAudTx, 256x RTPAudRx, 32x RTPAnc/BurstRx, 24x ColCorr (12x 3D-LUT based), 24x VidMix/Key, 16x VidRePlay, 128x AudRePlay, AudioGain, 3x 384 AudioSRCs, 563x AudioShuffler, 20x VC2Enc, 32x VC2Dec, 2x LTCGen, 3x VidGenlock, 3x AudGenlock, 2x VidSignalGen, AudioSignalGen silence/400Hz/440Hz/1kHz, 3x MasterClock LTC-Gen, 16x Audio N-Minus-1, 64x AudioMixer, 256x LoudnessMetering\n\n**AT300/JPEGXS_RX_100GbE** 32x RTPVidRX, 8x JPEGXSDec, 16x VC2Dec, 30x RTPVidTx ...\n\n**AT300/JPEGXS_TX_100GbE** 30x RTPVidTx. 8x JPEGXSEnc, 32x RTPVidRx, 32x VC2Dec ...\n\nRelease 2.5 supports **C100  AVP / AVP_40GbE / CC3D_40GbE / JPEGXS_40GbE / PCAP_40GbE / UDX_40GbE\n\nFor a detailed list of hardware capabilities, please load the application you wish to use and refer to http://<ip-address-of-your-AT300>/runtime_constants.json\n"
