		"changelog": "# Release 2.4\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis release is not state-compatible with previous software versions; configuration scripts\nneed to be adapted and will need to be reapplied.\n\n## New Features\n\n    **ALL** Add (RTP-only) support for 6G standards (HD2160p23_98, HD2160p24, HD2160p25, HD2160p29_97, HD2160p30)\n\n**AT300** added port_mode FEC / NO-FEC option for 100GE streaming ports\n\n**RTPReceiver** Support for adaptive video readout has been reintroduced\n\n**AT300** on link_up/address changes, all ports' IPv4 addresses are sent out in Morse code over the QSFP LEDs. Users not fluent in Morse code may use the Android App \"Morse Code Engineer\"; we found the following settings to work well:\n\n- speed 46 LPM\n- exposure correction 20\n- zoom level of ~6 to 8\n\n## Changes/Enhancements\n\n**ALL** fix potential case of spontaneous blade reboots wherein unresponsive http clients would trigger Linux's hung task detector\n\n**AT300** improve 2110-20 robustness against corrupted data\n\n**AT300** fix potential packet loss caused by reception of short network packets\n\n**AT300** improve robustness of packet age detection against network jitter\n\n**AT300** save port_mode in config file instead of state keyword\n\n**RTPReceiver** the RTPReceiver may now limit concurrent IGMP subscriptions to avoid oversubscription during MakeBeforeBreak switches. Reserved bandwidth defaults to 5% of the overall port bandwidth; use `r_t_p_receiver.settings.reserved_bandwidth` to change this\n\n**AT300** A `PCAP_100GbE` application has been added for 100G packet capturing, delayed retransmission, and randomized packet loss at user-configurable rates.\n\n**vapi/vscript** Node- and Deno-compatible package builds are now available via arkonatech.com.\n\n**RTPReceiver** Fixed packet space frame sync failure that could previously occur when running with `timing.target` set to `TimeSource`\n\n**RTPReceiver** Fixed 2110-20 pixel errors that could previously occur if packets were close to their maximum allowed size\n\n**WebServer** emit syslog messages on user authentication\n\n**RePlay** Freeze pixel format on panic freeze (changing metadata might otherwise cause SDI outputs to flicker on panic freezes, even though the actual video signal remained stable)\n\n**RePlay** Fixed incorrect mediaclock offsets reported by UHD frame syncs\n\n## Overview\n\n**AT300/AVP_100GbE** 36x RTPVidTx, 32x RTPVidRx, 511x RTPAudTx, 256x RTPAudRx, 32x RTPAnc/BurstRx, 24x ColCorr (12x 3D-LUT based), 24x VidMix/Key, 16x VidRePlay, 128x AudRePlay, AudioGain, 3x 384 AudioSRCs, 563x AudioShuffler, 20x VC2Enc, 32x VC2Dec, 2x LTCGen, 3x VidGenlock, 3x AudGenlock, 2x VidSignalGen, AudioSignalGen silence/400Hz/440Hz/1kHz, 3x MasterClock LTC-Gen ...  next Loudness-monitoring, audio mixer\n\n**AT300/JPEGXS_RX_100GbE** 32x RTPVidRX, 8x JPEGXSDec, 16x VC2Dec, 30x RTPVidTx ...\n\n**AT300/JPEGXS_TX_100GbE** 30x RTPVidTx. 8x JPEGXSEnc, 32x RTPVidRx, 32x VC2Dec ...\n\nRelease 2.4 supports **C100  AVP / AVP_40GbE / CC3D_40GbE / JPEGXS_40GbE / PCAP_40GbE / UDX_40GbE\n\nFor a detailed list of hardware capabilities, please load the application you wish to use and refer to http://<ip-address-of-your-AT300>/runtime_constants.json"
